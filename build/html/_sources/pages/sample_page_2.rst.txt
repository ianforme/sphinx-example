=================

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.
